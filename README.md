# Rubik's Cube Solver  

A Rubik's Cube solver built using **Java** that combines computer vision techniques with the **A\*** heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve cubes of any size.  

## Features  

- **Cube Scanning:**  
  - Uses OpenCV for detecting and classifying cube colors.  
  - Supports dynamic cube sizes (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).  
  - Provides real-time feedback with visual indicators for successful face scans.  

- **Solver Algorithm:**  
  - Implements the A\* heuristic algorithm to determine the shortest solution path.  
  - Generates step-by-step instructions for solving the cube based on its scanned state.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV

# Cube-Solver
Built a Rubik's Cube solver using Java with OpenCV for real-time color detection and classification. Implemented the A* heuristic algorithm to compute the shortest path for solving cubes of any size. Designed a dynamic system supporting various cube sizes with step-by-step solving instructions.
